# Re-start-Coding-Journey

I will continue to add frequent updates on what I've learnt day-by-day in this ReadMe. 

Moving on from CSS, JS is a whole different beast. 
Discovering arithmetic operators and boolean terms.
Key notes to remember:
% is a modulus which returns the remainder when dividing two numbers. 

== (Equal to)
!= (not euqal to)

=== (Strict equality)
!== (Strictly not equal)

&& gives true if both expression1 and expression2 are both true, if not then false
|| gives true if either expressions are true, otherwise false
! (logical not) infront of an expression will result in the opposite


METHODS for Arrays and Strings

.sort() will sort an array in alphabetical order
.push() will add a new element to the end of an array
.slice() will return the selected elements of an array
.replace() will replace a string with a new one
.unshift() will add an element to the beginning of an array
.pop() will remove the last element of an array
.concat() will join two arrays
.toUpperCase() will make all the letters in a string uppercase
